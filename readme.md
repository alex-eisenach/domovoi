## Domovoi "Butler"

This project started as a home-cooked idea to implement a VPN service at home
to avoid paying money for a real service. It evolved over time to incorporate
ad-blocking, dashboarding, and DevOps principles.

Inspired by one of my favorite series of books as a kid, Artemis Fowl, which
features "Butler" (Domovoi Butler), Artemis' personal bodyguard and absolute
badass.

May Project Domovoi guard my home network in the same spirit.
